Customer advocacy plays a critical role in the success of any business. Satisfied customers not only contribute to higher revenue but are also less likely to churn, making customer loyalty a key factor in long-term growth. One of the most common metrics used to gauge customer satisfaction is the Net Promoter Score (NPS), which helps businesses measure how likely their customers are to recommend their products or services. This program introduces a 2021 dataset from a retail bank, generated using real distributions of NPS scores. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding customer sentiment in the banking sector and offers an opportunity to explore the factors influencing customer advocacy and satisfaction. By analyzing this data, businesses can gain deeper insights into the patterns that drive NPS and make informed decisions to enhance customer loyalty.
